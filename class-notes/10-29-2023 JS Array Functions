-Array is a widely used data structure in any programming language/
-Data Structure: general term used for storing data.

You need to know a few things about each method of the array, string, object or whenever you learn a new method.

-methodName
-task that it runs
-does it take argument? If yes, how many or what type of arguments
-does it return anything? If yes, then what it returns


1. push() method
- add new elements to an existing array -  to the end - tail
- it may take one more multiple elements as arguments
- it returns the new length of the array as a number
- it changes the original array

2. pop() method

- removes the last element from an existing array
- it doesn't take any argument
- it returns the removed element back
- it changes the original array

shift vs unshift
unshit -> add - makes array longer
shift -> remove - makes array shorter

3. unshift() methods

- - add new elements to an existing array -  to the beginning - head
- it may take one more multiple elements as arguments
- it returns the new length of the array as a number
- it changes the original array

4. shift () methods
- removes the first element from an existing array
- it doesn't take any argument
- it returns the removed element back
- it changes the original array


5. includes () method
- checks if an element exist in an array and returns boolean
- it takes one element as an argument
- returns true if the element is present in the array, or false otherwise
- it does not change the original array

6. indexOf () method
- checks if an element exist in an array and returns the first found occurence's index.
- it takes one element as an argument
- it returns an index as a number (0 or positive if the element exists, -1 otherwise)
- it does not change the original array


7. lastIndexOf () method

- checks if an element exist in an array and returns the last found occurence's index.
- it takes one element as an argument
- it returns an index as a number (0 or positive if the element exists, -1 otherwise)
- it does not change the original array

8 concat () method
- concatenates / combines two or more arrays together
- it takes an array as an argument
- it returns a new array
- it does not change anything in the original Array

Spread Operator: The Spread (...) operator expands an iterable (like an array) into its individual elements


9. Reverse() method
- reverses the original Array
- it does not take any argument
- it returns the modified original Array
- it changes the original array 


10. Slice () method
- used to get sub-array from original array
- it takes either one or two 2 arguments as starting and ending indexes
- it returns sub-array
- it doesn't change anything in original array

11. Splice() method
- adds / removes or do both within array
- it takes 2 or more arguments
- first argument defines the position where new elements should be added/removed.
- second argument defines how many elements be removed
- rest of the arguments define the new elements to be added
- it returns the removed elements in an array

How do you understand if a variable is an array?
    - You can use Array.isArray() method to check if a variable is actually an array.
    - If this methods returns true, then the variable is array, otherwise it will return false stating the variable is not an array.

12. Array.isArray()method
- used to check if a variable is array
- it takes an argument to be checked
- it returns a boolean. It returns true if the variable is actually an array, false otherwise.
-it does not change anything with the original array.
