RECAP

- Loops are common concepts in any programming language and wildly used
- It eliminates dublicated codes and allows programmer to run a block of code repeatedly
- It saces time and effort for the programmer as well.

1. for loop (i loop) (traditional loop)
2. while loop
3. do-while loop
4. for...  of loop (arrays)
5. for... in loop (objects)

for (start; condiition; update) {
    // code block
}

while (condition) {
    // code block
}

do {
    // code block
} while (conidition);

while vs do - while :

- The only differene bt these is that do-while executes the block of code first, and then checks the condition.
On the other hand, while checks the condition first, and then executes the block of code.

NOTE: Above difference tells us, the do-while whill always execute the block at least ONCE even though
the condition is right away false.

4. for ... of loop
- Syntatic sugar added to for loop
- for ... of loop makes it easy programmer to work with arrays or all the other iterable objects
