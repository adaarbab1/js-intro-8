Loops: are used for repeated code in a block and makes our code more readable.
-Loops will execute until a termination condition is met.
-Loops are helpful to eliminate duplicating codes and time-effort saving.

iteration: each time of execution within a loop - each circle
infinite loop: that is a loop that never stops because of a logical mistake and termination
condition is never met.
