13. sort () Method
- used to sort array elements
    -Strings: alphabetically from A-Z and a-z
    -Numbers: You may expect to sort from smaller to greater number but it still sorts alphabetically
- it does not take any argument when you are sorting strings but we can some arguments to sort numbers as expected.
- it returns the original array back sorted
- it modifies the original array

SORTING NUMBERS with a comparison callback function!
callback function: is a function passed into another function as an argument.

const numbers = [ 1, 2, 5, 100, 21 ];
numbers.sort ((a, b) => a - b); // sorting ascending - smaller to bigger
numbers.sort ((a, b) => b - a); // sorting descending - bigger to smaller
console.log(numbers); // [ 1, 2, 5, 21, 100 ]

a          b        a  - b information
1          2        -1     1 should be before 2
2          5        -3     2 should be before 5
5          100      -95    5 should be before 100
100        21       79     100 should be after 21


14. flat () method 
- reduces the dimension of nested arrays with their elements
- if it is only one nested array, you don't need to but for more nested arrays, you may use dimension array
-it returns a new array which flattened
- doesn't change anything in original array

15. toString () method
- used to convert an array to a strings
- does not take any argument
- it returns a strings
